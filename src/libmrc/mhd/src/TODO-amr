- flux correction

- 2nd order interpolation (limited or not...)

- limited will not be easy, since it can't be put into a matrix :(

- 3-d, choose refinement per direction (e.g., 2:2:1)

- AOS doesn't work with AMR // indexing should be mrc_fld business, anyway

- mrc_fld aos vs non-aos could now be done without distinction because of the stride business
